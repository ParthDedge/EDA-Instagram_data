**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
EDA is a critical step in the data analysis process that involves examining and summarizing data sets to gain insights and identify patterns, trends, and anomalies. It is typically the first step taken after data collection and before building predictive models or making business decisions. The primary goal of EDA is to understand the data, discover relationships between variables, and generate hypotheses for further analysis. In this project I have used Instagram data for EDA and I have analyzed & identified the patterns, trends and relationship between the data parameters.
